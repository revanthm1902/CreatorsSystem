## About The Project

Creators System is an open-source task management platform built for AryVerse. It features role-based access control, real-time task updates, and a token-based performance tracking system to gamify productivity.

### Key Features

- **Role-Based Access Control** - Director, Admin, and User roles with hierarchical permissions
- **Task Management** - Create, assign, and track tasks with deadlines and token rewards
- **Director Approval Workflow** - Tasks created by Admins require Director approval before becoming visible to Users
- **Token System** - Points awarded for completing tasks on time
- **Real-time Activity Feed** - Live updates for user additions, task assignments, completions, and custom announcements
- **Real-time Updates** - Live task status updates via Supabase Realtime
- **Leaderboard** - Visual ranking of users based on accumulated tokens
- **Light/Dark Theme** - Toggle between light and dark modes
- **Auto Employee IDs** - Unique IDs generated automatically (e.g., `AV-2026-001`)
- **Secure Onboarding** - Temporary password with forced reset on first login
- **Profile Settings** - Users can update personal info, links, and passwords

### User Roles

| Role | Capabilities |
|------|--------------|
| **Director** | Full system access, manage all users (including Admins), approve Admin-created tasks, post announcements |
| **Admin** | Create/assign tasks, set deadlines & tokens, approve/reject user submissions, post announcements |
| **User** | View assigned tasks, submit completed work, track tokens, view activity feed |

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React 19 + Vite + TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4 (Dark Mode)
- **State:** Zustand
- **Icons:** Lucide React
- **Backend:** Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Realtime)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn
- [Supabase](https://supabase.com) account (free tier works)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/revanthm1902/CreatorsSystem.git
   cd CreatorsSystem
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up Supabase**
   
   - Create a new project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
   - Go to **SQL Editor** and run the contents of `supabase/schema.sql`
   
4. **Configure environment**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   
   Edit `.env` with your Supabase credentials:
   ```env
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
   ```

5. **Create your first Director account**
   
   - In Supabase Dashboard → **Authentication** → **Users** → **Add User**
   - Create a user with email and password
   - Copy the user UUID from the table
   - Run this SQL in the SQL Editor:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO public.profiles (id, full_name, role, is_temporary_password)
   VALUES ('YOUR_USER_UUID', 'Director Name', 'Director', false);
   ```

6. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   
   Visit `http://localhost:5173/setup` for the full setup guide!

## Login Instructions

### First-Time Setup

1. You need to create users in **Supabase Dashboard** → **Authentication** → **Users**
2. After creating the auth user, run SQL to create their profile in the `profiles` table
3. The **employee_id** is auto-generated by a database trigger (e.g., `AV-2026-001`)

### Login Flow

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Admin creates user in Supabase with temporary password |
| 2 | Admin runs SQL to create profile with `is_temporary_password = true` |
| 3 | User logs in with temporary password |
| 4 | System redirects to password reset page |
| 5 | User sets new password |
| 6 | User gains access to their dashboard |

### Role-Based Dashboards

- **Director** → Full access: Dashboard, All Tasks, Manage Users, Leaderboard
- **Admin** → Dashboard, Tasks, Users, Leaderboard
- **User** → My Tasks, Leaderboard

## Task Workflow

```
Admin creates task → Pending (awaiting Director approval)
       ↓
Director approves → Task visible to User
       ↓
User submits work → Under Review
       ↓
Admin approves → Completed (tokens awarded if on time)
       or
Admin rejects → Rejected (no tokens, task returns to Pending)
```

**Note:** Tasks created by Directors are auto-approved and immediately visible to Users.

## Activity Feed

The Activity Feed provides real-time visibility into team actions:

| Event Type | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `user_added` | When a new team member is added |
| `task_assigned` | When a task is created and assigned |
| `task_marked_done` | When a user submits their work |
| `task_approved` | When an admin approves completed work |
| `task_rejected` | When an admin rejects a submission |
| `director_approved_task` | When a director approves a pending task |
| `custom_message` | Announcements posted by Directors/Admins |

## Production Deployment

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

This generates optimized files in the `dist/` folder with code splitting for vendors.

### Deploy to Popular Platforms

**Vercel (Recommended)**
```bash
npm i -g vercel
vercel
```

**Netlify**
```bash
npm run build
# Drag dist/ folder to netlify.com or use CLI
```

**Railway / Render**
- Connect your GitHub repo
- Set build command: `npm run build`
- Set output directory: `dist`
- Add environment variables in the dashboard

### Environment Variables for Production

Set these in your hosting platform's dashboard:
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

### Supabase Configuration for Production

1. **Disable Email Confirmation** (recommended for internal tools):
   - Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Providers → Email
   - Turn off "Confirm email"

2. **Configure URL Settings**:
   - Authentication → URL Configuration
   - Set Site URL to your production domain
   - Add redirect URLs for your domain

## Scripts

```bash
npm run dev      # Start development server
npm run build    # Build for production
npm run preview  # Preview production build
npm run lint     # Run ESLint
```
